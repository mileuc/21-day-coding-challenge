Your task is to create a function that will take in an array representing the roster of astronauts, and return an array containing the jobs of each astronaut as a string.

In other terms, for each astronaut of the roster, you want to take the job and add it to a list, then return said list. 

Examples
Input:
    const exampleRoster = [
      {
        ...
        job:"Shuttle DJ"
      },
      {
        ...
        job:"Space Cook"
      }
    ] 
    

Output:
    ["Shuttle DJ", "Space Cook"]


Hint:
The goal of this challenge is to work with arrays and objects like you did in the previous challenges, with the addition of looping.
