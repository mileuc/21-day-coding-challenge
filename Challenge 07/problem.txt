Your task is to write a function that takes in the temperature, weather condition, wind speed, and direction as parameters and store them inside a structure that holds 
each value as properties.

There's a small and important detail for this one, you must convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and convert the wind speed from miles/hour to meters/second, 
and round both of them before storing them.

The information that LARRY gave you about temperature conversions are in the hint section.

Examples
Input:
    const temperature = 32
    const condition = "Sunny with small clouds"
    const windSpeed = 20
    const windDirection = "NNE
    

Output:
    {
      temperature:0,
      windSpeed:9,
      windDirection:"NNE",
      condition:"Sunny with small clouds"
    }
    
    
Hint:
The goal of this challenge is to convert multiple values, store them and group them inside an object.

Fahrenheit to Celsius with : (temp - 32) * 5/9

Miles/hour to meters/seconds with : speed / 2.237
