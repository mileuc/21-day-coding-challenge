Your task is to write a function that will take in two position objects. 
Calculate the average speed from the two positions and return the average speed rounded to the first decimal point.

Each object contains the altitude in meters, and a time stamp in seconds. 

Examples
Input:
  const firstPosition = {
    time: 1637074462,
    altitude: 1100
  }
  const secondPosition = {
    time: 1637074558,
    altitude: 2200
  }
    

Output:
  11.5
		
Hints:
The goal of this challenge is to work with objects and rounding. You can learn more about those by clicking the links below.

For the average speed, consider that the shuttle is flying straight up at a constant speed. (altitude difference / time difference)
